Objectives
This report examines Japan’s equity markets and has three main objectives: analyze the current macro environment, determine an attractive entry point using historical price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, and evaluate different methods of investing (or what kind of active manager to use).
Macroeconomic Environment
After reaching a high last year, Japan’s equity markets have pulled back amidst mixed investor sentiment and inconclusive economic data.  Much of the buying in the Japanese market over the last 18 months has come from macro funds pushing the “long equity and short yen” trade.  In the first few months of 2014, Japanese equities retraced some of its gains as foreign investors started unwinding their investments and taking profits, producing sharp levels of volatility.  
However, the market has rallied recently alongside positive news flow that started in May: April CPI overshot expectations, preliminary data indicates the tax hike didn’t hurt consumption as much as initially thought, and the BOJ finally announced an aggressive growth strategy plan (aka Third Arrow) to tackle Japan’s structural issues.  
Four major issues are discussed below: the corporate tax rate, asset allocation changes for the government pension, corporate earnings, and negative CPI and/or consumption data and its implications for additional quantitative easing.

Lowering the Corporate Tax Rate
Japan has an effective corporate tax rate of 35.64%, the 2nd highest in the G7 and the highest among its Asian neighbors.  Prime Minister Abe intends to lower the rate to 20-29% over the next few years to help corporations boost capital investment, to increase competitiveness on a global scale, and most importantly, to encourage wage increases.  Wage increases are a crucial component of Abe’s plan to reach core inflation of 2% by next April (rising consumer prices without a concurrent rise in wages would squeeze private consumption and risk sending the economy into another deflationary period).  A lower corporate tax rate is expected to help companies increase profits, thereby driving share prices higher.
In regards to Japan’s precarious fiscal position, each 1% cut in the tax rate would require about 470 bil yen from other revenue sources.  However, while the BOJ has a massive amount of debt on its balance sheet (debt-to-GDP is currently about 227%), Japan’s budget deficit as a % of GDP has improved from 9.2% to 7.6% in 2014.  
       


Government Pension Investment Fund - Asset Allocation Changes
In April, Japan’s 128.6 tril yen pension fund overhauled its investment committee, adding 3 members of a state panel that pressed for a decrease in bond holdings and appointing Yasuhiro Yonezawa as head of the committee.   The pension’s current targets are 60% domestic bonds, 12% domestic stocks, 11% foreign bonds, 12% foreign stocks, and 5% cash.  According to a Bloomberg survey of 10 fund managers, strategists, and economists, the GPIF may cut its domestic bond target from 60% to 40% and increase holdings of domestic stocks from 12% to 20%.  An increase from 12% to 20% of domestic equities could pump more than 10 tril yen into the Tokyo stock market.  It’s unclear how the other 12% from local bonds will be allocated, but most expect some combination of foreign stocks and bonds.  In addition, Takatoshi Ito, a prominent Japanese economist and professor at the University of Tokyo, has stated the GPIF should trim domestic bonds to 35% and increase total equity holdings to 50% in order to offset rising inflation.  
The GPIF is already selling local debt and there are indications it’s buying equities.  The GPIF and other Japanese pension funds had 1.85 tril yen in net sales of JGBs during the first 3 months of the year.   Trust banks, which manage 70% of the GPIF’s passively managed stock portfolio, bought 687.3 bil yen worth of stocks in May, the most since March 2009.  While it’s unclear how much of this money is actually from the GPIF, market players views trust-bank flows as a possible gauge of the GPIF’s moves.  
Corporate Earnings:  ROE, Buybacks, and Capex
Earnings by Topix-listed companies increased 69% last year as unprecedented central bank stimulus drove down the yen and boosted profits.  Top-line growth of +12% was four times the growth rate produced in the US.  Japanese companies generated 8 tril yen in cash last year (more than double the amount of any year in the last decade) and non-financial firms held a record 232 tril yen in cash and deposits at the end of March 2014.  Japan’s cash-to-market cap ratio is 22%, double that of any other developed nation.  

Japan has one of the lowest corporate ROEs among developed nations.  The BOJ recognizes a functioning economy requires corporate profits to be returned to the public and has been creating incentives to increase good corporate governance practices.  For example, Pensions can only invest in companies with high ROEs.  The 10-year average ROE through 2013 was 6.2%, less than half of the S&P 500’s.  However, things are starting to improve- companies listed on the Topix earned an 8.6% ROE in the year through last quarter, the highest since the 12 months ended March 2008.  
Recently, Japanese companies have been buying back shares at the fastest pace in history, prompted by a combination of record cash flow, low valuations, and pressure from the government to increase ROE.  Since January, 152 companies in the Topix announced buybacks worth 2.5 tril yen.  The previous annual high was 1.5 tril yen in 2008 and the average over the last decade was 567 bil yen per year.  Buybacks are expected to continue, providing a floor for equity prices.
Companies are buying back shares to boost ROE in the short term, but for the strategy to succeed over the long term, substantial investment into capex will be necessary.  With more than 50% of GDP being held in cash by corporate Japan, capex is expected to be the next driver of the economy, particularly for Retailers and Real Estate.  Although businesses have boosted capital spending for three straight quarters, there is still room to grow- investments in the quarter ended March were still 31% below their 2007 peak.
